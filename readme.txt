Task 2

For task 2 all you need to do is have all the files download and you have to run this program by the terminal.
There is a Main.class file in the src folder you could just use the command "java Main head_number" then it should be running and have questions printed
if there's nothing happened then using the command "javac Main.java" then using the command "java Main head_number" to run the program.

For the two options about how the program get the numbers.
This program provide two ways to get the numbers
First is the program will generate 1000 random number and write then into a input.txt file then read from the file and store them into an integer array with size 1000
Second is you have to have a file with 1000 numbers ready and copy the file path and paste it under the question. FILE PATH NEEDED NOT ONLY THE FILE NAME.

Then just follow the question it will show the result.

The data i used that in the output pdf are stored in the test.txt just in case.
